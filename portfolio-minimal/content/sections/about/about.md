I'm an enthusiastic full-stack engineer who is graduating from [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) in May 2022. 

In addition to 1 year of SWE Co-op experience from [SAP](https://www.sap.com/canada/) and [Citibank](https://www.citigroup.com/canada/en/), 
I have a hacker and entrepreneur spirit. 
I have won 5+ prizes from hackathons and was awarded a [Service Award for Women in CS](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/award/2021/06/visier-service-awards-computer-science) from UBC. I'm a proactive leader of community for [Women in CS](https://ubcwics.com/) and [Korean Developer meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-KDD). 

I love to expand my passion with your company, team and you.
